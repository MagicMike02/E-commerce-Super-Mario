# E-commerce-Super-Mario
University project using html5, css, js, jquery, php (XAMPP), ajax, sql and json/xml, and almost everything is responsive from 360 to ~2k px

Website which allows normal users to buy items from the shop, it allows to mantain session from users (using php sesisons).
Shortly, it allows, using ajax, async request from the db about the product to show and dinamically inject it the website. 
there are 2 tyoe of users: adming and comun users. An admin is allowed with multiple function, in the profile section, which allows to manage the e-commerce (with function such as: add, remove, modify, product and add admins). 
Kinda basic but it's well enough designed for the accessibility of its use.

It's not that much but for a 6cfu exam is enought
Still need:
  some security update for fever php file about url injection of back-end process file 
  maybe even some refactorying of some .php file which may be unified
  finish some pages which are empty
  
  
Better description will come soon...
